# ptmpls - pppppass' TeX Templates

This repository ptmpls is a macro set about TeX or LaTeX templates made by
  [pppppass](mailto:lzh2016p@pku.edu.cn).
Held on
  [GitHub](https://github.com/pppppass/ptmpls),
this repository consists of
1. Personal macro package `pdef.sty`,
2. Note class `pnote.cls`,
3. PKU-style paper class `pkupaper.cls`,
4. PKU-style slide class `pkuslide.cls`.

It should be mentioned that the documentation is under construction on the
`doc` branch. It is planned that the macro set will be merged into a single
`ptmpls.dtx` file. Thus, there will be two readme files in the folder at the
same time, one of which is the original one to clarify licenses, and another
is generated from `ptmpls.dtx` and overwrites the original one when
extracting.

To extract the package, simply use the command `lualatex ptmpls.dtx`. For
detailed usages, please refer to the package documentation `ptmpls.pdf`,
together with the preamble and postamble in each file.
